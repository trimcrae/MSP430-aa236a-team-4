** PLEASE NOTE THAT THIS IS PART OF A PRERELEASE OF SALVO 4
FOR PIC24 AND dsPIC CONTROLLERS AND AS SUCH SOME DOCUMENTATION
IS NOT YET AVAILABLE **

These projects follow this naming convention:

  tu[1-6]lite.mcp    Salvo Lite project, built with Salvo library
  tu[1-6]le.mcp      Salvo LE   project, built with Salvo library
  tu[1-6]pro-lib.mcp Salvo Pro  project, built with Salvo library
  tu[1-6]pro.mcp     Salvo Pro  project, built with Salvo source

These projects are intended for use in the MPLAB SIM simulator.

Because this is a simulator project, interrupts are not used.
Instead, a system tick is synthesized by a simple countdown 
timer that "ticks" within main()'s infinite loop. 

The standard Salvo hook for controlling global interrupts is
used. If you use this project as a basis for creating new
Salvo projects, then this standard hook allows the calling of
Salvo services from any interrupt source disabled by the DISI
instruction. Better performance can be had by creating your
own salvohook_interrupt.c file with individual control of
interrupts through the IECn registers. 

See the Salvo documentation for more information.
