These projects follow this naming convention:

  tut5tlite.hzp     Salvo Lite project, built with Salvo Lite library
  tut5le.hzp        Salvo LE   project, built with Salvo LE library
  tut5tpro-lib.hzp  Salvo Pro  project, built with Salvo Pro library
  tut5tpro.hzp      Salvo Pro  project, built with Salvo source

These projects implement tutorial program #5 of the Salvo User Manual.
See the User Manual for a more detailed discussion of this application.
They are intended for use with IAR Embedded Workbench for MSP430.

The default Salvo hook for controlling global interrupts is
used. If you use this project as a basis for creating new
Salvo projects, then this standard hook allows the calling of
Salvo services from any interrupt source. Better performance
can be obtained by creating your own salvohook_interrupt.c file
with individual control of interrupt-enable bits on a
peripheral-by-peripheral basis.

These projects are for the MSP430F169, but will work with any MSP430
device with similar peripherals. To select a different processor,
select the project in the project window, right-click and select
Options..., select General Common ConfigurationOptions -> Target,
and select the appropriate processor.

See the Salvo documentation for more information.
