DESCRIPTION:

This application is an SD Card demo program for Pumpkin CubeSat Kits fitted
with PPM D1 (PIC24FJ256GA110).

This application is built from a variety of sources and requires that all of 
the software listed above be installed. 

When running and connected as per the block diagram above, the user will be 
presented with one terminal screen:

  * J2: a status display, with timestamps in system ticks, with 
     informational messages
  * J8: a status display, with timestamps in system ticks, with 
     informational messages
     
This application runs a couple of tasks that demonstrate acquiring and 
releasing the SD Card resource, and writing to and reading from the SD Card.

EFFS-THIN is a product of HCC-Embedded, http://www.hcc-embedded.com.
CubeSat Kit customers who purchase the EFFS-THIN SD Card Library
receive EFFS-THIN for the PIC24 in library form (no source code).
  
To use EFFS-THIN, add these two files to your project:

  /Pumpkin/CubeSatKit/PIC24/Lib/MCC30-vX/lib_effs_thin_pic24-sm-coff-N.hza
  /Pumpkin/CubeSatKit/PIC24/Src/effs_thin_mmc_drv_spi1.c
  
and add the following include path to your project's User Include Directories,
under Project -> Properties -> Preprocessor Options -> User Include Directories.

  /Pumpkin/CubeSatKit/HCC-Embedded/EFFS-THIN/src  
  
Then, #include "thin_usr.h" in all of your files that use EFFS-THIN services,
and #define CSK_EFFS_THIN_LIB to be N in your project, e.g. under Project 
-> Properties -> Preprocessor Options -> Preprocessor Definitions.

NOTE: The lib_effs_thin_pic24-sm-coff-N.a library is precompiled. Therefore you 
cannot / must not make any changes to the EFFS-THIN header files in the directories
above, or your program may not function correctly.

This program demonstrates the use of EFFS-THIN on the CubeSat Kit. To use, 
format an SD card as FAT16. Build this application and download it to your CubeSat 
Kit Development Board. Start the application, then (hot-)plug the SD card into 
the SD card socket. Connect via HyperTerminal to your CubeSat Kit's USB.
You will see that the application is writing to the SD card. The card can be 
removed from the Development Board and you can view the contents of CSK_TEMP.TXT.
